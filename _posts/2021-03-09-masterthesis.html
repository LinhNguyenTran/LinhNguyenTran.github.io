<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>A well-known problem of quantum chemical calculations of vibrational frequencies is the deviation of calculated frequencies from the experimental ones. Therefore, it is common to apply an empirical scale factor with an associated uncertainty, to approximate these values and to compensate for occurring errors. The reason for these errors is not random, but rather due to a systematic bias referring to the neglect of vibrational anharmonicity and to the incomplete incorporation of electronâ€“electron interactions. In this work, we not only present an overview of the status of uncertainty quantification in computational vibrational spectroscopy, but also report scale factors and their associated uncertainties for 47 reference data sets from the scientific literature as well as for self-constructed vibrational data sets consisting of only carbonyl stretching vibrations of 71 carbonyl compounds, evaluated with the PBE and B3LYP exchange--correlation functionals and the def2-TZVP and LANL2DZ basis sets. Furthermore, we examine the accuracy, transferability, and robustness of these scale factors with statistical resampling methods, i.e., Bootstrap and Jackknife, which can obtain the mean and standard deviation of the scale factors through their representative sampling distribution. The results reveal that the scale factors and their associated uncertainties obtained in this study are in good agreement with the reference values. The best approximation for the experimental vibrational frequencies was developed with the PBE and B3LYP exchange--correlation functionals. In addition, we demonstrate that the scale factors are slightly more robust for the reference data sets than for the self-constructed data sets. The reason for this is the smaller size of the self-constructed data sets as well as the even distribution of the additive and fractional bias. This implies that each data point contributes equally to the resampled data set, resulting in a slightly higher standard deviation and statistical range. Overall, it becomes evident that the Bootstrap and Jackknife resampling method can obtain robust and transferable scale factors, which are resistant to bias within the original data set. The accuracy of the scale factors verify the possibility to correct the errors that cause the differentiation of the experimental and calculated vibrational frequencies. Lastly, the findings not only recommend improved theoretical methods for developing vibrational frequencies, but also a proper construction of the data sets considering their chemical space coverage, size, class of vibrational frequencies, and the spread of the original data set for the precise determination of reliable scale factors. These observations might provide a basis for the development of an error estimate for other molecular properties, such as the partition function.</p>
