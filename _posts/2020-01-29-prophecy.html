<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>An important task in theoretical physics and quantum mechanics is the generalization of different concepts and principles, such as magnetic domains and the formation of domain walls in ferromagnets and ferrimagnets in the field of micromagnetism. However, understanding ferromagnetic materials on a macroscopic scale allows to relay key information in a concise and engaging way to a deeper comprehension about the characteristics such as stripe domains and perpendicular magneto-crystalline anisotropy which enables the possibility to develop magnetic devices and therefore realizing spintronic applications such as energetically efficient information and communication technologies. </p>
