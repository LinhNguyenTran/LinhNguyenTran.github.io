<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>In this work, we observe whether the structural distortion of a bridging ligand in a given molecular structure with a
    high relative contribution to the total coupling constant J is influencing the total coupling constant more than the distortion 
    of a bridging ligand with a low contribution to the total coupling constant \textit{J}. For this purpose, the first part of the analysis focuses on 
    the observation of the total coupling constant of dinuclear dimanganese complexes with a different amount of oxo- and acetato bridging 
    ligands enabling a series of different bridging motifs, to find a correspondence between the total coupling constant and the bridging 
    ligands. The second part of the analysis focuses on the distiortion of the oxo and acetato ligands, leading to the observation of the 
    relative contributions to the total coupling constant. The comparison of these two procedures resulted in a comprehensive investigation of
    the influences of the deflection effects on the total coupling constant. The evaluating data were collected by employing the Green`s 
    function approach studied by Steenbock et al. We demonstrate that the oxo-bridged compounds are tending to facilitate the antiferromagnetic coupling,
    contributing with high negative antiferromagnetic values to the total coupling constant, whereas the acetato-bridged compounds tend to contribute
    with low positive ferromagnetic values to the coupling constant. Moreover, we discover a reliable analysis about the effects of varying structural
    parameters of the used dinuclear dimanganese molecular structures, leading to reputable statements on which specific fragments are dominating the
    spin coupling and the exchange pathway interactions. Finally the results suggest that an accurate structural optimisation of a bridging ligand with a
    greater contribution to the coupling constant may be more important than an accurate optimisation of those parts of the molecule with a low
    contribution. This observation might be a basis for further property-dependent convergence criteria for improved computational efficiency. </p>
