<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>Vibrational spectroscopy is very important for the analysis of specific characteristics of a molecule, e.g. its structure or its bonding behavior. Ergo, vibrational spectra are widely used as finger prints for adsorbed molecules and therefore for chemical identification. With the help of quantum chemical calculations, it is possible to aid this process of identification, because experimentally generated vibrational spectra are often limited due to the reason that the observed spectra and the molecule do not have a conclusive connection. The interplay of quantum chemical vibrational calculations and experimental data, allows for a deeper understanding of the connection between the molecular structure and the vibrational spectrum. For this reason, it is valuable to have an efficient computational method to create an accurate result in comparison to the experimental data.</p>
