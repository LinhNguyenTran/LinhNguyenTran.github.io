<p>I am a Master graduate in Nanoscience at the University of Hamburg. Nanoscience is an interdisciplinary study that moves between the intersection of chemistry and physics. Throughout the last years of my studies I was able to gain knowledge in the field of computational chemistry and in the development of quantum mechanical modelling methods for quantum chemistry. I worked on computational calculations of complex molecular structures and machine learning based algorithms and I have gained solid knowledge in coding and scientific programming. </p>

<p>I successfully completed my Masterâ€™s thesis in the working group of Prof. Dr. Markus Reiher at the Department of Physical Chemistry at the ETH Zurich. 
    In this time I was able to explore my knowledge in the field of computational quantum chemistry and to deepen my specialization in this field. Through furhter internships in the field of theoretical chemistry and physics I was able to gain further programming knowledge. I am very enthusiastic about new technologies in the field of AI-supported research and solution development using machine learning methods.</p>
